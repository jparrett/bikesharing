## Overview
The first step is to view the trips by hour.    Looking at this information below, it is clear that there are more popular times than others.    The morning popular times are 7am - 9am.   Even more popular is the evening start times between 5pm and 6pm.

Narrowing down the research, looking now at the gender breakdown.   The first graph visualizes that there is no distinct difference between the hour of the day that different genders utilize the bikes.   It mirrors the first graph above.    What both graphs do show is that this is a large difference between the genders.   Males tend to rent more often than females by a significant amount.
